# Tonswap - FunC Smart Contracts

## TonSwap is live on TON mainnet.

TonSwap is live on TON mainnet. TonSwap is in Beta, use at your own risk

## Overview

TonSwap is a DEX/AMM using the Uniswap V2 curve (a financial model shared by many popular AMMs like PancakeSwap, QuickSwap, Sushi) to create liquidity pairs and allow traders to swap tokens and liquidity providers to supply liquidity and earn rewards.

The project depends on an Jetton standard implementation for [Jetton](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/token-contract/tree/jettons/ft).

## Develop

run `npm install`

### Compile contract and run tests

This project depends on the executables **fift**, **func** . You can build them from [source](https://ton.org/docs/#/howto/getting-started), or you can download the [pre compiled binaries](https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-binaries/releases).

### Func Compiler

This project is using the latest func features such as `#include` and `const` so please use the latest func compiler ,
If you want to set an explicit func path you may use the FUNC_PATH environment variable `export FUNC_PATH=/usr/local/bin/func`

### Run tests

the project uses [ton-contract-executor](https://github.com/tonwhales/ton-contract-executor) package to run Jest based tests.
Use `npm run test` to execute the test suite.

### Run TVM-BUS tests

run `npm run test-bus` 
this tests are different then the tests in `/test/amm-minter.spec.ts`, 
Because this tests are using [ton-tvm-bus](https://github.com/ton-defi-org/ton-tvm-bus) , each tests starts in a single message, and the message passing between contracts is done automatically, messages with statInit are auto deployed , messages find their receiver automatically unlike in the first test suite.


### Run end to end test on Mainnet or Testnet

`npm run e2e` (this process will generate a deploy wallet during it`s execution)

### build for web 

`npm run build:web` - this process will generate json files with hex value for the contract, both for `amm-minter.fc` and `amm-wallet.fc`;
